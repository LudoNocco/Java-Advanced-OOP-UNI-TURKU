# What is my proposed solution?
I would implement a read-only interface that library patrons can interact with, while staff members will be given full access to the complete book class.

In my implementation, the “Ibookinfo interface” will only include getter methods for book information, the “Book class” will implement the ibookinfo interface, hence including both getters and setters. Ultimately, to control access, patrons will only be able to access ibookinfo references in read-only, whereas staff will receive book references with full access.

Given these specifications, Patrons won’t be able to modify book data in the interest of security. The code will be efficient because we only have one class serving both patrons and staff, while making minimal changes to existing Book class structure. 
Overall, in terms of the advantages of this course of action, the Book class will maintain internal consistency.

However, a few issues that I see is that improper casting could compromise the encapsulation by potentially exposing the complete functionality of the Book class. Furthermore, the responsibility will sit with staff members to ensure that whenever they make modifications, they will preserve the class invariants. 
Nevertheless, I still believe it’s a good balance between security needs and ease of implementation.

# Potential implementation

## IBookInfo Interface

```java
public interface IBookInfo {
    String getTitle();
    String getAuthor();
    int getYear();
    String getPublisher();
}
```

## Book Class

```java
public class Book implements IBookInfo {
    private String title;
    private String author;
    private int year;
    private String publisher;
    public Book(String title, String author, int year, String publisher) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.year = year;
        this.publisher = publisher;
    }

    @Override
    public String getTitle() { return title; }
    @Override
    public String getAuthor() { return author; }
    @Override
    public int getYear() { return year; }
    @Override
    public String getPublisher() { return publisher; }

    public void setTitle(String title) { this.title = title; }
    public void setAuthor(String author) { this.author = author; }
    public void setYear(int year) { this.year = year; }
    public void setPublisher(String publisher) { this.publisher = publisher; }
}
